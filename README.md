# PRODiGY_DS_03

## Description
This repository contains a simple demonstration of a Decision Tree Classifier using a CSV dataset.

## Files

- **bank_1.csv**  
  This is the dataset file used for building and evaluating the classifier.

- **descion_tree_classifier.py**  
  This script implements a Decision Tree Classifier in Python. It reads the `bank_1.csv` file, processes the data, trains the classifier, and evaluates its performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sri-Krishnan007/PRODIGY_DS_03.git
    ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7 or above) and install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3. Place your dataset as `bank_1.csv` in the project directory if you want to use your own data.
4. Run the classifier script:
    ```bash
    python descion_tree_classifier.py
    ```

## Example Directory Structure

└── descion_tree_classifier.py
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the column names and structure in your CSV match what the script expects.
- The script can be modified to suit different datasets or configurations as needed.
